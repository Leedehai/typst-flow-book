= Introduction
Welcome to the main body of the book. As you can see, the page numbering has restarted at 1.

We can easily drop a side note into the alternating margin reserved by our package#footnote[This is a footnote.] layout #book.note[This is a side note].

If you want to index a specific term, like Typst, you just call it like this #book.index[Typst] #book.index[$Omega$-vibration]. It will automatically appear in the Term Index at the back of#footnote[This is a footnote #lorem(20)] the book#book.note[This is a side note. #lorem(20)].

== Welcome

#lorem(200)#book.note(dy: -2em)[This is a side note. You see, you can move me higher than my anchor with `dy`.]

#lorem(200)#footnote[This is a footnote #lorem(20)]

Don't confuse DOG#book.index[DOG] and DoG#book.index[DoG].
This is a *laptop computer*#book.index("computer!laptop"), and
this is a _desktop computer_#book.index("computer!desktop").
Again #book.index("computer!desktop").
We have $integral x^2 dif x$ #book.index("Math!integral_of_x2", display: $integral x^2 dif x$)
